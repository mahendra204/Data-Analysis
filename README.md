    inaights:
    -----------------
    ---> In march month having the highest sales and orders.
    
    ----> Women are more likely to purchase as compared to men that we can observed in the report.
    
    ----> in Maharstra, Karnatak and Utterpradesh are the top 3 states where the sales are maximum.
    
    -----> Amazon, flipkart and myntra are the three channels are the maximum contributors among all remaining.
    
    -----> Adult age group  is the maximum contributing to the sales.
    
    ------> As a data analyst i would suggest stakeholders like women are more likely to purchase things related to thier cloths and those are mostly in adult age 
            from maharastra, karnataka and utterpradesh states in amazon, flipkart and myntra shoping channels so i would suggest keep attract those people to make
            more profit in the business vrinda store.
