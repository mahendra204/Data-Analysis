## Daily temperatures of major cities in different regions 

The data set collected from kaggle website and done data analysis by using exploratory data analysis using pandas.

we can see in the table we have different regions,cities, avgtemperature,year and day to day wise each and every records has given.

by using pandas we can easily findout the required insights rather than excel since it take much time to analysis.

I found many things that in which city has high avg temperatue, low avg temperature and in which regions and what months and many more things i have found from this 
analysis.

Thanks for visiting, keep learning and this will surely gives you the confidence.
